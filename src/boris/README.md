# Algorithm

1. Write function `calcAlphabeticCouples(str: string)`
2. Split and calc the alphabetic couples count for each string. Find a substring with the biggest number of alphabetic couples. If several have the same length take the latest.
3. Write function `findMostRareLetter` to calc the most rare letter, if there are several letter choose the one closest to the beginning of the alphabet.
4. Calc how many repetitions, function `calcRepetitions`
